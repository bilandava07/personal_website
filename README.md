## Overview
Inspired by my Computer Networks lecture, I wanted to learn more about hosting and networking.  
After receiving a **Raspberry Pi 5** as a birthday gift, I decided to use it to **build and deploy my own personal website**, fully self-hosted at home.

The website runs with:
- **Flask** + **SQLite** for the backend  
- **Gunicorn** + **Nginx** for production  
- **Cloudflare Tunnels** for secure, free remote access  

This setup allows me to avoid paying monthly for a static IPv4 address.  
The only recurring cost is about **€10/year for the domain**.

## Cycling Page – The Main Motivation
The core reason for this project was building the **cycling page**, which solves a real problem for me.  

After my rides, I wanted to share experiences with friends who don’t use Strava or Komoot.  
Those platforms focus on performance metrics (watts, heart rate), while I mainly wanted to share **photos and short stories**.  

Previously, I shared photos across WhatsApp, Telegram, and other apps — messy and repetitive.  
Now, with my own site:
- I upload everything once  
- Add a short summary  
- Share the experience in one place  
- Keep memories safely stored and organized with **search and sorting options**

## Development Journey
I built this website in **three weeks**, teaching myself:
- Fundamentals of **HTML** and **CSS**  
- A bit of **JavaScript** for interactivity  
- Backend **development and deployment**  
- Basics of **responsive front-end design**  
- Realities of running a **self-hosted web application**  

This project gave me practical, hands-on experience in both backend and frontend development, while learning how to manage my own infrastructure.
